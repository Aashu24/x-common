Write a program that will correctly determine the least number of coins to be given to the user such that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change.

For example
An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return fifteen cents or [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return two dimes or [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
