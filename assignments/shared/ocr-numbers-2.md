A simple numeric font has been constructed using only pipes and underscores.

The number consists of four rows high, three columns wide:

    _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #
                               # fourth line is always blank

There may be several numbers in the input text, one per line.
